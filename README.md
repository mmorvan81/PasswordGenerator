Javascript Assignment Unit 3 - Generating a password

To obtain a password went through the following procedures
    - how many characters do you want
    - an alert on how many you can have

* could not figure out how to have this precede everything else.
    - asking if you want uppercase
    - asking if you want lower case
    - asking if you want special characters
    - asking if you want numbers

As of this version, I still was not able to then generate the password.

Have been working on the final piece but have had some difficulty.
